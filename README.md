# Jetpack Compose Animation Research

This repository explores various animation techniques and concepts within Jetpack Compose, aiming to provide insights and practical examples for creating engaging and interactive user experiences.

## Project Overview

This project delves into the world of animations in Jetpack Compose, covering topics such as:

* **Basic Animations:** Exploring fundamental animation APIs like `animate*AsState`, `AnimatedVisibility`, and `animateContentSize`.
* **Transitions:** Investigating how to create smooth transitions between UI states using `updateTransition` and `AnimatedContent`.
* **Gestures and Interactions:** Integrating animations with user gestures and interactions to enhance responsiveness and feedback.
* **Custom Animations:** Implementing custom animation logic using `Animatable` and `rememberInfiniteTransition`.
* **Performance Considerations:** Analyzing the performance implications of different animation approaches and optimizing for efficiency.

## Key Features

* **Practical Examples:** The project includes a collection of practical examples demonstrating various animation techniques.
* **Code Snippets:** Each example is accompanied by clear and concise code snippets, making it easy to understand and adapt.
* **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation provides explanations and insights into the animation concepts and APIs used.
* **Experimental Features:** The project may explore experimental or upcoming animation features in Jetpack Compose.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application to explore the animation examples.
